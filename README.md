**Note (12/08/2019):**
This was a programming challenge that I undertook in May 2018. Feel free to download and play around with this, but please keep in mind it is not an adequate representation of my current skills as a Unity developer.
Feel free to contact me at work.harrisonshort@gmail.com if you're interested in seeing examples of more up to date work. Thanks!

# HarrisonShort RSG Programming Challenge Submission

**Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show my programming skills. I received "Unity 3," which tasked me with cloning the popular arcade game Space Invaders. In comparing to the task sheet provided, I have completed the following explicit tasks:**

*-Implemented in C# in Unity*

*-Entire project, include all code and period commits, are in this public GitHub repository*

*-Player controls their character (represented with a green rectangle) to fire missiles and move left and right*

*-Player must destroy enemies before they approach or they will lose*

*-Waves of enemies (represented by red rectangles) continue to move downwards towards player, and will shoot randomly*

*-Score is displayed at the top of the screen*

*-When player reaches 10 points, they win and will be prompted to restart the game*

*-When player dies, they lose and will also receive this prompt*


**In addition, I have looked into some of the "Bonus Point" features for implementation. Namely:**

*-The game has particle effects when characters are destroyed*

*-Text is animated*

*-A power up (named Second Chance, which allows the player to take an additional hit), has been implemented*

*-Players can access a JSON file in the game's StreamingAssets, and change the amount of waves and enemies that will spawn in those waves.* **More information is below:**

Two builds are included, one named "(Basic)" and the other "(Json)". The (Basic) build features the specifications of the challenge itself, where the player wins after hitting a score of 10. The (Json) build finds the amount of enemies to kill and then makes that the new score target. Currently, there is only functionality to add a grid of enemies (number of waves (rows) by number of enemies (columns)). To edit the JSON file, navigate to: ...\HarrisonShortRSGProgChallenge\Builds\ (JSON) Harrison Short RSG Programming Challenge\ (JSON) Harrison Short RSG Programming Challenge_Data\StreamingAssets\Wave.json. The JSON file can be edited in various text-editing software, such as Notepad, or Visual Studio. Just change the numbers to what you desire. There is a maximum of 5 enemies by 10 waves, for the sake of performance and screen space.

**Controls:**

*Movement:* A+D/Left+Right Arrow Keys

*Fire (also restart game):* Left Mouse/Space Bar

*Quit:* Escape

Font used in the game: https://www.dafont.com/block.font

Thank you again for providing me with the opportunity. If you have any questions, or would just like to get in touch, my details are below (please contact me via email if you need my phone number, as this repo is public). I look forward to hearing from you!
