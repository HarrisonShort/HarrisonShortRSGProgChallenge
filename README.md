# HarrisonShort RSG Programming Challenge Submission

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to show my programming skills. I received "Unity 3," which tasked me with cloning the popular arcade game Space Invaders. In comparing to the task sheet provided, I have completed the following explicit tasks:
